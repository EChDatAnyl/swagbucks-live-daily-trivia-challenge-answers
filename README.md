### Best way to use this repository
Before you begin the Daily Trivia Challenge, have the [swagbucks-live-questions-answers.md](swagbucks-live-questions-answers.md) file open. When the question appears on your device, press `Ctrl+F` on your keyboard and type unique words that are in the question or answers. Don't search for very common words like `the`, `and`, `of`, `in`, etc. That way, you can find the question and its answer more easily and faster. This repository will be more useful when it collects more and more questions and their answers.

> **_NOTE:_**  Questions ARE repeated, so you could encounter the same question being asked days apart.
